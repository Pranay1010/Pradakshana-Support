# Pradakshana ‚Äì Privacy Policy
_Last updated: October 28, 2025_

Pradakshana (‚Äúthe App‚Äù) is developed by **Pranay Kammari** (‚Äúwe‚Äù, ‚Äúus‚Äù, or ‚Äúour‚Äù). This document explains how we handle your information when you use the App.

---

## 1. Information We Collect

- **Device Sensors:** When automatic counting is enabled, the App reads magnetometer data to detect pradakshina rotations. Sensor data is processed locally and never leaves your device.
- **Manual Entries & Notes:** Counts, targets, and notes you enter are stored only on your device. We do not sync or transmit this information to any server.
- **Diagnostics (optional):** Crash logs or analytics are not collected unless you explicitly share them with us via email.

---

## 2. How We Use Information

- To display your pradakshina count and progress.
- To store and show your personal notes and targets.
- To provide haptic feedback and reminders.
- To improve the App if you voluntarily share diagnostics with us.

We do **not** sell, rent, or otherwise share your data with third parties.

---

## 3. Data Storage

All data is stored locally on your device. If you uninstall the App, your data is deleted. If you switch devices, you are responsible for exporting or backing up any notes manually.

---

## 4. Third-Party Services

Pradakshana does not integrate third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services. The App relies on the device‚Äôs built-in sensors and operating system frameworks provided by Apple/Google.

---

## 5. Children‚Äôs Privacy

Pradakshana is intended for general audiences. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us and we will delete it.

---

## 6. Security

We use standard security practices and rely on the security features of the operating system. Because data stays on your device, safeguard your device with a passcode or biometric lock.

---

## 7. Your Rights

Since no personal data leaves your device, rights such as access, deletion, or correction are handled directly by you. You can delete or reinstall the App at any time to remove stored data.

---

## 8. Changes to This Policy

We may update this policy as the App evolves. Changes will be posted at this page with a new ‚ÄúLast updated‚Äù date. Continued use of the App after changes indicates acceptance.

---

## 9. Contact

üôè Thank you for using Pradakshana. May every pradakshina be filled with devotion and peace.
