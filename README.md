## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Try This |
| ----- | -------- |
| App cannot auto-count pradakshina | Make sure the device sensors are enabled (Settings → Privacy → Motion & Fitness). |
| Add Circle button not responding | Close other apps, then relaunch Pradakshana. The manual buttons should be available immediately. |
| Notes not syncing between devices | Notes are stored locally to keep your sankalpa private. Export manually if you switch devices. |
| App won’t launch after update | Delete and reinstall Pradakshana; your stored counts reset, but notes can be copied beforehand. |

## Feedback & Blessings

Every pradakshina brings grace. If Pradakshana has helped you stay focused on your spiritual practice, we’d love to hear from you—and a review on the App Store or Google Play helps other devotees discover peace too.

🙏 **May every circumambulation be filled with devotion and joy.**
